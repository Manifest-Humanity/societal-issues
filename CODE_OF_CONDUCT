# Code of Conduct

_This Code of Conduct is based on the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct), which is adapted from the [Node.js Policy on Trolling](http://blog.izs.me/post/30036893703/policy-on-trolling) and the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)._

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community dedicated to helping society through innovative solutions that transcend flags, borders, and religious boundaries while remaining fully legally compliant.

## Our Standards

In the Manifest Humanity community, we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don't just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they're off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.

### Discourse as Our Fuel

We recognize that meaningful discourse—even passionate disagreement—is essential to creating innovative solutions for society. We do not expect to all agree with each other, and healthy debate is encouraged. Our goal is to maintain an environment where we can challenge ideas vigorously during policy discussions while maintaining mutual respect for the individuals behind those ideas. Think of it this way: we should be able to disagree strongly during meetings but happily buy one another a coffee afterward.

### Pillarism and Balance

We adhere firmly to Pillarism and are committed to upholding the balance of the three pillars of society: government, market, and people. Our discussions and solutions should consider the interconnected nature of these pillars and avoid solutions that would destabilize this essential balance.

### General Guidelines

If someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could've communicated better — remember that it's your responsibility to make your fellow community members comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to create positive change in the world. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.

- Please avoid using overtly sexual aliases or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
- Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
- Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
- We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term "harassment" as including the definition in the [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md); if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
- Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact us via our Support Forum on Discord immediately. Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.
- Do not make casual mention of slavery or indentured servitude and/or false comparisons of one's occupation or situation to slavery. Please consider using or asking about alternate terminology when referring to such metaphors in technology.
- Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.

## Moderation

These are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct. If you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact us via our Support Forum on Discord.

1. Remarks that violate the community standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner).
2. Remarks that maintainers find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.
3. Maintainers will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
4. If the warning is unheeded, the user will be "kicked," i.e., kicked out of the communication channel to cool off.
5. If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.
6. Maintainers may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.
7. If a maintainer bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that maintainer, or with a different maintainer, via our Support Forum on Discord. Complaints about bans in public channels are not allowed.
8. Maintainers are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a maintainer creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.

The enforcement policies in the code of conduct apply to all official Manifest Humanity venues, including Discord channels and GitHub repositories.
